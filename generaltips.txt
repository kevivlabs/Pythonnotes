For a collection of items if asked to find the n largest or n smallest

Either we sort it and then return the sorted(items)[:N] #first sorting and then returing the first n smallest
sorted(items)[-N:] #sorting first and returning the largest by counting in negative

or use heapq
import heapq
print(heapq.nlargest(n,items))
