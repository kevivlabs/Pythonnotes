[@classmethod vs @staticmethod]

In general if you feel like the method doesnt do anything with the class in itself , then its better to make it a static method

E.g

@classmethod
def from_string(cls, emp_str):
  first,last,pay = emp_str.split('-')
  return cls(first,last, pay)
# here in the above return we are using the cls instance in the method , so its better to use a classmethod


@staticmethod
def is_workday(day):
  if day.workday() ==5 or day.workday()==6
    return False
  return True
# we havent used the class anywhere here so better to use static method

[Help function]
print(help(CLASSNAME))
gives the method resolution order

[None as arguments]

Dont pass immutable data types as default arguements
