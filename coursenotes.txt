a= "hello"
dir(a) #this will list all available methods
or dir(int)
dir(float) 

[Debugging]
1)Use print for debug
2)and also print(f'Number: {type(number)}') #this gives the type of number printed
3)import pdb and pdb.set_trace()

[pdb usage]

(Pdb) l  #(type L in small case to see the line in which we are , this is normally line after pdb.set_trace() )
after that its like ipython , we can easily check values

(pdb) c #for continue

[data types]
Have it in binary with 0b, octale 0o and hex with 0x

>>> c=0b101010111
>>> c
343
>>> d=0o454312
>>> d
153802
>>> e=0xac4d
>>> e
44109
to convert use bin(number) or oct(number) or hex(number)

[for division]
by default normal division gives float 10/5 = 2.0
to have only int values use double divide 10//5 = 2

.4e7 means .4 *10^7 
 4e-4 means 4 divided by 10^4
 
 c='hi "I wasn\'t there" ' 
 \' to escape the character which you think is not the closing 
 
 \n for newline
\t for tabs

[raw strings]

b=r"hello\t stranger"
print(b)
hello\t stranger # its useful to take the text as is without the formatter being excluded, useful for REgex

[triple quotes strings]
print(""" this is triple quoted , isn't it """ ) # dont need to escape single quotes or double if used
also for doc strings
""" this is a sample functon which takes one arg and returns int """
